FIBONACCI RUNTIME The time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the Fibonacci number computed. In this case, n = 10. The loop iterates from i = 3 to i <= count, which is a linear iteration and performs a constant amount of work (calculating the sum of two numbers and updating two variables). Since the number of iterations is directly proportional to the input count, the time complexity is O(n).

FACTORIAL RUNTIME The time complexity of this program is O(n), where n is the number for which you are calculating the factorial.
